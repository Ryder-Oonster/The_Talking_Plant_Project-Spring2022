One of my most notable projects involved building a C++ program to interface with an Arduino, controlling a moisture sensor and displaying a plantâ€™s needs based on the readings. 
I took the lead on coding and circuit design, and successfully completed the A-grade prototype under tight deadlines.
More images and videos will be added to this repository detailing the circuitry, design of the pot, and presentation at the Northeastern University First-Year Student Expo for Cornerstone of Engineering, Spring 2022.
